A secure, portable, and configurable Ubuntu-based development environment packaged as a Docker container,
purpose-built for remote development workflows. Designed with containerization in mind, it offers isolated, consistent,
and reproducible environments that enhance both development productivity and system security. Pre-built for multiple
architectures with publicly accessible daily automated builds and a simple setup process. Ideal for rapid onboarding
and consistent dev environments.
