My open-source personal site and portfolio, built with Astro's pre-rendered island architecture and a Bun-powered
build chain for sub-second loads and perfect Lighthouse scores. A lean Tailwind design system delivers just-enough
interactivity while shipping almost zero client-side JavaScript. Automated GitHub Actions deploy each commit to
Cloudflare Pages and serve it through Cloudflare Workers, pushing fresh content to edge POPs worldwide in under a
minute.
