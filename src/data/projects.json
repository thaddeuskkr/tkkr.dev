The solution incorporates an appointment booking system, queue management, an administrative portal, and an online store with cart functionality. It also leverages WhatsApp for OTP-based login/identity verification and patient notifications. The tech stack — Flask, Jinja, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and jQuery — is organized into a clear, modular code base. Deployed via Docker in the cloud, it uses GitHub Actions for seamless automated image builds. As project leader, I oversaw both the hosting environment and database logic, ensuring efficient workflows across the team. I also structured the overall code base, developed the administrative dashboards, implemented login and user management, and provided guidance when my teammates needed it.",
