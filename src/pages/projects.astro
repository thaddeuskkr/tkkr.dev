                I developed Nova, which is an open-source, self-hosted URL shortener built with TypeScript and Bun,
                designed for both ease of use and powerful functionality. It offers a simple web interface and an
                intuitive API for seamless URL shortening, with features like password-protected links, customizable
                slugs (including multiple per URL), and expiration-based short URLs. Nova is easy to deploy with Docker,
                making it a great choice for developers and businesses looking for a simple and flexible self-hosted
                solution.

                I led the development of a web application designed to streamline patient management for small clinics.
                The solution incorporates an appointment booking system, queue management, an administrative portal, and
                an online store with cart functionality. It also leverages WhatsApp for OTP-based login/identity
                verification and patient notifications. The tech stack — Flask, Jinja, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and jQuery
                — is organized into a clear, modular code base. Deployed via Docker in the cloud, it uses GitHub Actions
                for seamless automated image builds. As project leader, I oversaw both the hosting environment and
                database logic, ensuring efficient workflows across the team. I also structured the overall code base,
                developed the administrative dashboards, implemented login and user management, and provided guidance
                when my teammates needed it.

                A comprehensive litter detection, monitoring, and notification system built with AWS services and camera
                technology. It employs AI/ML to identify litter and notifies relevant personnel once a specified
                threshold is reached, ensuring timely clean-up before it accumulates. The solution features a robust
                backend and a streamlined frontend.
