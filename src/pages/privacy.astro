            <p>
                Welcome! This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information I collect, how I use it, and the
                steps I take to protect your data when you use my services or visit my websites. I'm committed to
                safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly. This
                applies to any service hosted on <span class="font-semibold">tkkr.dev</span> or
                <span class="font-semibold">tkkr.link</span> (including subdomains).
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="font-semibold">TL;DR:</span>
                I don't sell your data and I don't track you.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold">1. Information Collected</h2>
            <p>
                When you visit my websites and use my services, your IP address and device information are logged. These
                logs are automatically deleted when the service restarts (typically every few days) and aren't
                persistently stored on my servers unless explicitly stated otherwise. This site uses Vercel Speed
                Insights and Vercel Analytics, which may collect and store info about your device and IP address. You
                can learn more about how Vercel handles data in their <a
                    href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    class="text-purple-300">Privacy Policy</a
                >. No cookies are set by me.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold">2. Google OpenID Connect (OIDC) / Single Sign-On (SSO)</h2>
            <p>
                I use Google OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication on some of my services. When you log in using your
                Google account, I receive basic profile information (like your name, email address, and profile picture)
                to create your application account and store your application data. This info is used solely for
                authentication purposes and isn't shared with third parties. You can revoke access to your data at any
                time through your Google account settings.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold">3. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                I take the security of your data seriously. I implement appropriate technical and organizational
                measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. That said,
                no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I do
                my best to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, I can't guarantee absolute security.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold">4. External Links</h2>
            <p>
                My websites and services may link to external sites that I don't own or operate. I'm not responsible for
                the content or privacy practices of those sites, so I recommend reviewing their privacy policies before
                sharing any personal info.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold">5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If I do, I'll post the changes on this page.
                Continued use of my sites and services after updates means you accept the new terms.
            </p>
